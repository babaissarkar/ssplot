2. Draw polar plots
3. Draw grids.
6. Fixed points and nullclines support
7. Bad ticks when zoom is reduced below 1.0.
9. Assign properties correctly to plots after selection from data viewer window. Properties overhaul.

## Bugs

List in DataViewer not cleared after Clear Plot
Plotting area shrinks in 3d mode. Hardcoded plot area size?
setting plot color does not work on 3d ODE
ticks disapper after resizing plot window + incorrect axis length makes it look cutoff
setting title via menubar causes it to be not updated in data viewer (see also Bug #1 above)

## Enhancements
dataset viewer needs more padding. table is flush with window
FR: Showing angles on top + snapping to a particular angle might be a nice idea
X/Y/Z duplication in DataViewer
