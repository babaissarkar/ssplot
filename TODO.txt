1. Draw Z axis. Move the axes as the object is rotated.
2. Draw polar plots
3. Draw grids.
4. Autoscale and zoom by mouse. (DONE)
5. Function plot (DONE, 2D still needed)
6. Fixed points and nullclines support
7. Bad ticks when zoom is reduced below 1.0.

8. plotting in 1d, y(x) = x doesn't work because of Long != Double, but y(x) = parseFloat(x) works.
9. Assign properties correctly to plots after selection from data viewer window. Properties overhaul.
